## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the `revString.c` program, you will need a C compiler such as GCC.

### Compilation

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing `revString.c` and run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o revString revString.c
```

This will generate an executable named `revString`.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
./revString
```

Upon execution, you will be prompted to enter a sentence. The program will then output the reversed sentence.
